                  The interface that was chosen for this project was a washing machine which allows users to wash their clothes and select the options
                  they want to use for this particular load of laundry.
                  This washing machine has a standard door which opens into a chamber where clothes can be put into.
                  On the top right hand corner of the machine, there is a drawer to put in detergent and at the top of 
                  the machine there is a panel with different types of wash options for this load of laundry that the user 
                  can choose.

                They were motivated to use this laundry machine because it was free. User 1 very easily finds the door
                to the washing machine and opens it and starts to <span class="highlight-text">shove in </span>their laundry. They also easily find the drawer
                to put the <span style="color:#2a3a27 ;">laundry detergent</span> into. However, they seem a bit confused about which container in the drawers 
                to actually put the laundry detergent. They struggle for a few minutes and eventually find the right container.
                User 1 then looks at the options the washing machine has and takes a few minutes to pick out the one they want 
                and press start.

              <ul class="list">                
                <li>The users generally agreed that this washing machine was  <span class="highlight-text">well designed.</span> For example 
                  the handle for the door allowed the user to know that it could be pulled and that it opened into 
                  chamber where they put the clothes. There are also  <span class="highlight-text">minimal distractions</span> on the interface which helped in finding
                  the laundry tray which also had a handle, indicating to users that it could be pulled out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The users also noted that the  <span class="highlight-text">labels</span> for each of the laundry options on the 
                  laundry panel were very <span class="highlight-text">clear</span>. 
                  For example, the temperature
                  settings were conveyed in common terms such as  <span class="highlight-text">"warm", "hot", or "cold"</span> instead of acutal temperatures like 30 degrees
                  farenheit. The soiled option also provided a <span class="highlight-text">picture</span> next to each option so users could figure the appropriate
                  settings based on the state of their clothes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A <span class="highlight-text">difficulty</span> observed by both User 1 and User 3 was 
                  <span class="highlight-text">where to put the laundry detergent in the detergent</span>
                  drawer. <span class="highlight-text">User 3</span> mentioned that the different containers were all labeled <span class="highlight-text">"WASH"</span> 
                  which were not very helpful in 
                  finding where to put the detergent. <span class="highlight-text">User 1</span> also mentioned that the text that was labeling the container were in small white raised
                  text, which was the same color as the containers, and made it hard to see.
